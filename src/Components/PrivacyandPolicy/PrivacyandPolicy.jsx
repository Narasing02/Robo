              <p>
                We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill
                the purposes for which it was collected, including any legal,
                accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the
                appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature,
                and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm
                from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we
                process your personal data, and whether we can achieve those
                purposes through other means. Once the purposes for which the
                personal data was collected are no longer relevant, or after a
                user requests deletion of their data, we will securely delete or
                anonymize the data, unless legal requirements dictate otherwise.
